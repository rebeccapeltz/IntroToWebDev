# Notes: JavaScript

###

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Along with HTML and CSS, it is considered a core technology for the web. JavaScript is an imperative language, meaning that instructions are provided as sequential commands, unlike HTML and CSS. JavaScript commands usually result in "state" changes. The term "state" in programming refers to a variable or system's value at a given time.

JavaScript is used in both browsers and servers. Humans interact with browsers, and servers interact with browsers and other servers. The term "Front-End" developer refers to a developer who writes applications that run on browsers and mobile devices. "Back-end" developer refers to developers who write application programming interfaces (APIs).

JavaScript in the browser makes it possible to create interactive applications where users can change state and modify data.
