# Notes: HTML Forms

HTML Forms use elements to collect data. Once the data has been collected, JavaScript can process it in the browser.  Data processed in this way can be used to modify the DOM.  Forms can also submit data to servers.  In this course, we'll focus on processing the data in the browser and updating the DOM.

### Form Elements

The input tag is used to render form elements. Its type property determines the element's presentation on the web page and the type of data it holds.

As shown in the [Form Sampler,](https://replit.com/@RebeccaPeltz/form-sampler) many types are available for the input element.
