# Project: Mad Libs

Mad Libs is a word game in which the player is asked to fill in the blanks of a story without knowing the story or where the words they enter will end up in the story. The HTML and CSS for this project are provided in the GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/rebeccapeltz/js-event-handling/tree/main](https://github.com/rebeccapeltz/js-event-handling/tree/main). If you've already imported this into a Replit project for the Dynamic Style Change project, you can add your code there. Otherwise, import the GitHub project.
