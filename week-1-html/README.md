HTML is a universal language that provides structure to a web page. This structure is essential not only for organizing content but also for allowing tools like screen readers to read and comprehend its meaning. Ultimately, the web developer aims to create an exciting and accessible document that communicates an important message to the user.

Web developers may work alone or in teams, but their messages must be coded to meet the specifications of the HTML language in order to reach their users.
