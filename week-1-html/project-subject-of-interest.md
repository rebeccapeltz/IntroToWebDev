# Project: Subject of Interest

This is an assignment where you will choose a photo you find interesting and some URLs that you can link to from a web page that are related to the photo. You'll create a paragraph about your photo and then code some items in a list that allow your user to navigate to the web pages that relate to the photo.

Here are some specific instructions:

* Navigate to [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) or [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* Use the search tool to find a horizontal image (width is greater than height) that you find interesting
* Download the image on a device that you can run replit on so that you can upload it to replit
* Start a replit with an HTML/CSS/JS Template
* Upload the image to replit
* Modify the HTML content so that you can write a paragraph, display an image, and provide a list of links to web pages that related to the image

Use the tags below to render elements from your HTML code:

* **h1** Header 1
* **p** Paragraph
* **div** Division
* **img** Image
* **h2** Header 2
* **ol** or **ul** Ordered List or Unordered List
* **a** Anchor
* **li** List Item
* **footer** Footer

Here's a picture of a pages created to fullfill these requirements.
