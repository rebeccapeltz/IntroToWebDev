# Project: Image Gallery

In this project, we'll create two image galleries. They both use a FlexBox layout. The first arranges images by row and the second by column. This project is based on a blog post from [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/). Reading developer blogs like those provided by LogRocket is an excellent way to learn new coding techniques.

### Create a Replit Project By Importing from GitHub

To help you start this image gallery project, a repository on GitHub has fake images set up. You can import this repository code into Replit to start a new project.

This is the URL to the repository containing the image gallery code: [https://github.com/rebeccapeltz/image-galleries](https://github.com/rebeccapeltz/image-galleries)

#### Instructions for Importing a GitHub Repository

1. Copy the repository link into your clipboard.
2. From your Replit dashboard, click "Create Repl".
3. Click Import from GitHub in the top right corner instead of choosing a template.

5. Click on "Import from GitHub".  You'll see a title page with a navigation bar to view other pages.

### Instructions for the Project

Upload or create links online for at least 6 images to put into the galleries. Import the starter code.  Notice that the Flex by Row code shows the title below the image, but the Flex by Column code uses animation to overlay the title on the picture when you hover over the image.

Ensure you can spot the code patterns described in the readings in **Notes: Flexbox.**
