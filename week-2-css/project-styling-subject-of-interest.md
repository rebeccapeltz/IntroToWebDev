# Project: Styling Subject of Interest

### Subject of Interest Project

In this project, we are going to add style, aka CSS, to the Subject of Interest Project that was completed in the HTML Chapter.   We'll focus on a few efforts, but you are encouraged to try CSS not mentioned in the list of requirements for this project.

The layout for the HTML Subject of Interest web page is left-aligned.  The font is the default determined by the browser, and its color is black.  The background color is white. This is the default if no other CSS is applied. In this exercise, we will:

* center all the elements on the page
* add text and background colors
* add font family

### Center Items on the Page
