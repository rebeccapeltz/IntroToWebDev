# Notes: Flexbox

### Introduction to Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional model that only deals with one dimension at a time: row or column. However, it often produces two-dimensional layouts because it has a wrap property that allows elements to wrap around, giving the appearance of multiple rows or columns.
