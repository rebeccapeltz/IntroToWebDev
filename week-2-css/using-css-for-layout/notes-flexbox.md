# Notes: Flexbox

### Introduction to Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional model in that it only deals with one dimension at a time: row or column. However, it often produces two-dimensional layouts because it has a wrap property that allows elements to wrap around, giving the appearance of multiple rows or columns.

Responsive Layouts

Responsive layouts are those that can work with different **viewport** sizes.  A viewport is the size of a phone, table, or screen used to view web pages.  These screens come in various sizes.

The table below summarizes the width and height of different device screens.  This is not a complete list.

| Device  | Width  | Height |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| Laptop  | 1440px | 900px  |
| Tablet  | 1776px | 1024px |
| Desktop | 1920px | 1080px |

When we create layouts, we have to consider how they would appear on another device. On a laptop, we could show four images across, but on a mobile device, we could only show one image per row.

The Chrome browser has tools to help see what a web page would look like on different devices. To activate the Responsive layout, open the Inspector and then click on "Toggle Device Toolbar".
