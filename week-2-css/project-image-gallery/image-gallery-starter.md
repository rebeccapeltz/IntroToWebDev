# Image Gallery Starter

In this project, we'll create two image galleries.  They both use a FlexBox layout.  The first lays out images by row and the second by column.  This project is based on a blog post from [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/responsive-image-gallery-css-flexbox).  A good way to learn new techniques in coding is to read developer blogs like LogRocket provides.

### Create a Replit Project By Importing from GitHub

To help you start this image gallery project, a repository on GitHub has fake images set up. You can import this repository code into Replit to start a new project.
