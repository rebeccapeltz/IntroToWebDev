### CSS Selectors

This [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) can help you see the variety of properties you can use in your CSS file.

The list below shows the properties we'll use in this week's assignment:

* `*` all elements
* `body`,`span`,`ul`, `li`, `img` are HTML elements and styles will be applied to all
* `.container`, `.heading-text` and many more are classes you can make up the names yourself, and they are referenced by the `.` in front
* `#id` the `#` in front of a name indicates an element with a unique ID that has been supplied as an attribute of the element
