Web developers use tools. They are digital tools, just as a hammer and saw are to a carpenter. Web developers have access to hundreds, if not thousands, of tools that can help them be more efficient, innovative, and technically accurate.

The tools available can be applications installed on a local computer, cloud services, or web applications provided on the Internet. In this course, there will be an emphasis on tools provided via cloud services. We'll create free tier-level accounts on these services, which will provide us with tools to write and host code.
