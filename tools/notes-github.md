# Notes: GitHub



### GitHub

GitHub is a service that allows users to store, manage, and collaborate on developing softare applications.  It is the largest community of developers.  In 2023 there were over 100 million developers using GitHub and 420 million repositories.   I think of it as a coder's social network because it provides ways to share code and issues.
