# Notes: Replit + GitHub Integration

### Connecting Replit to Github

Connecting Replit to Github involves installing Replit on GitHub by connecting the GitHub service to Replit, and requesting authorization from GitHub to allow the Replit user to push code to GitHub. &#x20;

Our process starts by writing code.  In order to push this code to GitHub we need create a GitHub repository.  The steps below will connect us to GitHub, create a repository and push the code to GitHub.  We only need to run the step that connect to GitHub the first time we want to push code from Replit.  After that, the connection will be setup and we only need to use the Replit Git User Interface to  authorize the user and create a repository and push code.
