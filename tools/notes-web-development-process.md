| Term            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cloud           | The cloud is a network for servers located around the world and accessible via the internet. Cloud services are applications available on on the cloud.                                                                                     |
| IDE             | Interactive Development Environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Replit          | Cloud based online IDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GitHub          | Cloud based code storage, management, sharing and web hosting.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Version Control | GitHub provides version control for each repository using branching and merging to allow collaboration and push/pull to load and retrieve code to and from the repository.                                                                  |
| Branch/Merge    | Technique that allows for collaboration and experimentation with code while maintaining a current branch “main”. A repository user can create a branch, make changes, make a pull request for approval and then merge into the main branch. |
| Local/Remote    | Developer maintains local and remote repositories. Changes are synced using push and pull commands.                                                                                                                                         |
| Add/Commit      | As you make changes in the local repository, you add files that are staged locally and when you’re ready to push, you commit them.                                                                                                          |
|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Web Development Workflow

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Web Development Workflow</p></figcaption></figure>

Web development workflow starts with writing code, followed by saving the code in a code repository, and finally publishing the code to a location where is can be accessed on the web.  In this course we'll use replit.com as an IDE to write code.  Then we'll sync our code in Replit to GitHub.  Syncing code to GitHub is a repetitive activity because we sync it after we add to it or make changes.  Finally we'll host the code on github.io which is a service offered by GitHub known as GitHub pages.
